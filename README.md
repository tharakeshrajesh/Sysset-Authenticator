a weird authenticator where you use your system settings like volume, brightness, and etc. as an authenticator to set passwords and everything.

```

PASSWORD=<that one password thing from google i forgot>
COOKIE_SECRET=<cookie secret, can be anything>

# I hate everything
This was the most annoying thing I have ever made. I spent abotu 15 hours on this project.<br>
It also still sucks if you can't tell by looking at the code. It is NOT organized, good looking, etc.<br>
Please give me some credit though because at least it works right.

# Cookies
I never finished implementing so yeah, deal with it and stuff.<br>
